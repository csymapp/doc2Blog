## docs2blog

> Blog and Static site generator using google docs.

## What it is

In line with our philosophy of making technology as affordable as possible, Docs2Blog helps you to set up a website/blog at zero cost using tools you are already familiar with (Google docs, sheets, github and colab). You may only need to learn a new tool during the set up. Once that is done, all you need to create new articles/posts on your website is to create new google docs documents.To start using it, all you need to do is to open [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/csymapp/docs2Blog/blob/master/notebooks/docs2Blog.ipynb).

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) guide for more details.
